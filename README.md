# Interferometric-Data-Augmentation
Step-1-Synthetic Data Generation on mutiple C values: This folder contains two mat files; one of them is the code for generating synthetic data and other contains the function(the "xc_fonction_xs_interpol_f_xs.m" file should be placed in the folder in which the main code file is present. Load this code in matlab and change the paths; you can generate different images under different conditions of c and noise for simulation.
Step-2-Input Images Data labeled: Once Images are generated then annotate them; this folder contains all annotated images which we used as input, you can use them directly or if you wang your own data then annotate them in PASCAL-VOC format from this github repository(https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg).
Step-3-Data Augmentation-Anisotropic Scaling: This folder contains all the codes used for anisotropic scaling as our novel augmentation method.
Step-4-Experimental-Sgnals-to-Images-Conversion: This folder contains all the codes of experimental signals to images conversion into a sweet spot.
